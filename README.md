- 👋 Hi, I’m @philiperskine!

- 👀 I’m currently learning coding and computer science to reskill as both a software engineer and an IT professional.
  
- What I'm learning:
  - 🐍 I’m improving my Python skills by working through the projects in Al Sweigart's book 'Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python' (4th ed.) [I'm currently on Chapter 7: 'Designing Hangman with Flowcharts'].
  - 💻 I'm studying for the CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+) exam, which I am sitting in mid-October 2024.
  - 🖱️ I'm upskilling with Microsoft Learn, so if you would like to see my skill level and find out what I've learned, check out my profile via the link below.
