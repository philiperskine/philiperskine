- 👋 Hi, I’m @philiperskine!
- 👀 I’m currently learning coding and computer science to reskill as both a software engineer and an IT professional.

- 💻 I'm also studying for the CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF+) exam, which I intend to sit before the end of 2024.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects.
